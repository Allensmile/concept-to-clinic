# Concept to Clinic Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free and positive experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Staying Focused On The Goal

The goal of this challenge is to help physicians save lives. **Prizes are not the central purpose of the competition and serve only as a way to make this challenge more fun and attract the broadest array of talented contributors.**

As with any collaborative technical project, we expect there to be differences in opinion regarding design decisions and implementation. We encourage constructive criticism and discussion of issues on their technical merits. At the same time, project maintainers have a duty to make difficult and timely choices between competing ideas and ensure that continuing discussions remain productive and don’t become a burden on the project.

Transparency and fairness are important to us, and we want to hear from contributors when they have questions or concerns about decisions, including those involving points or prizes. Good faith questions or concerns may be directed to project staff by e-mail and will be given careful attention. However, the following behaviors do nothing but distract from the core goal of the challenge, and make the experience worse for everyone:

- Debates about who should be (or should have been) awarded points or prizes carried out in any of the project’s technical venues such as comments on issues or pull requests.
- Personal attacks or excessive public litigation of points or prizes in any venue including those external to the competition.

Since these behaviors violate the spirit of the challenge and bog down development, it will constitute a violation of this Code of Conduct to debate points and prizes in any of the project repositories or community discussion channels, including the forum.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
- Violations of the "Staying Focused On The Goal" section above including debate over points or prizes on the project repositories or forum


## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.


## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at concepttoclinic@drivendata.org. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
